## Hi, I'm Ruan

Junior Developer returning to software development and building toward full-stack web development.

### Currently Learning
Focused on fundamentals and rebuilding strong habits after time away from development:

- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub

---

### Projects
Here are some of my early projects:

#### Liquid Invoice Template
A Shopify Liquid invoice template I customized and built from scratch.  
- Dynamic: handles orders, addresses, line items, discounts, taxes, and shipping logic.  
- GitHub-safe version: all personal/company info removed.  
- Showcases skills in **Liquid templating, HTML, CSS, and dynamic data handling**.
